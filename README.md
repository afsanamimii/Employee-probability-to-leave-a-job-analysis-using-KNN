# Employee-probability-to-leave-a-job-analysis-using-KNN
In this section I analysis a multidimentional mixed dataset having both numeric and catagorical data.
Based on different attribute for example DailyRate, Education,JobLevel, Job satisfiction e.t.c I tried to predict their prability of continuing a job

For this analysis I applied two different method KNN and Naive bayes where the KNN gives the highest accuracy(Around 82%)
